                    <p>“We originally found this place, by driving past it and stopped for a pizza slice. So delicious and what a huge slice, cut in two for a very inexpensive price. Second time we decided to try a whole pizza, an individual lasagna, and pasta with meat balls. It came with Italian bread. Totally unbelievable ! The lasagna was to die for. So cheese-y, meaty and the sauce, very traditional ! Huge portion ! The fettucine was homemade and so light and tasty. The pizza was gigantic with tons of the toppings we ordered. This food lasted us two days, due to the fact that there was so much food ! A family run business, using their recipes. I only wish I could make lasagna like they do! I will definitely be going back there !”</p>

                    <p>“Abruzzo is a wonderful dine-in pizza experience compared to what we are all exposed to in our social media age, take-out or delivery. Although the much sought after choice seeing that we are accustomed to having pizza as a staple at almost any gatherings, intimate or group. Cheap, fast and reliably everywhere!</p>
                    <p>This dynamic combination of doughy goodness and cheese IN A BOX is forgotten because you devour everything in sight once it reaches your table at Abruzzo's accompanied with their caesar salad and espresso to end the meal for a quick energy revival.</p>
                    <p>Prices are reasonable for the quality and portions you get and the staff, ambiance is warm and inviting.”</p>
